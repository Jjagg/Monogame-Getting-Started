# Overview

### This guide was created to help you get started developing games with Monogame.


This guide primarily explores how to create 2D games, but Monogame can create 3D games too.

This guide doesn't require you to have any previous programming experience.

You'll just need a computer and a bit of patience.


First let's take a look at some of the games that have been created using Monogame.

### Pretty cool, huh?


Game development can be fun and rewarding, but often beginners lack easy to understand tutorials and documentation.

That's why this guide was created - to help those unfamiliar with Monogame. 

Using this guide you'll build a monogame project, load some game content, then modify and display it on your screen.

We'll even cover input and managing game state, explaining everything in detail as we go.


### Guide Conventions


To the left is the navigation for this guide. 

Clicking an orange link will load the corresponding tutorial in this right handed area.

Images and screenshots will often be embedded into tutorials, along with links to assets that you may need to complete the tutorial.

Assets can be downloaded from links, or you can find all the assets in the /Assets folder of this guide, if you downloaded the guide. 

All tutorials will be using **Visual Studio**, but you can use any IDE with Monogame support.


Sometimes code will be displayed in a tutorial. It looks like this:


```cs
This is some C# source code.
```


You are encouraged to copy and paste this code into your project, then modify it to suit your needs.


That's about it for guide conventions, let's get started by
