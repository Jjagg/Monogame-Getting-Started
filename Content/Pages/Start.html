<h1>Overview</h1>
<h3>This guide was created to help you get started developing games with Monogame.</h3>

<p>
This guide doesn't require you to have any previous programming experience.<br>
You'll just need a computer and a bit of patience.<br>
This guide primarily explores how to create 2D games, but Monogame can create 3D games too.<br>
This guide was last updated on <b>3/5/2017</b>.<br>
<br>
First let's take a look at some of the games that have been created using Monogame.<br>

<h3>Pretty cool, huh?</h3>
<p>
Game development can be fun and rewarding, but often beginners lack easy to understand tutorials and documentation.<br>
That's why this guide was created - to help those unfamiliar with Monogame. <br>
Using this guide you'll build a monogame project, load some game content, then modify and display it on your screen.<br> 
We'll even cover input and managing game state, explaining everything in detail as we go.<br>

To the left is the navigation for this guide. <br>
Clicking an orange link will load the corresponding tutorial in this right handed area.<br>
Images and screenshots will often be embedded into tutorials, along with links to assets that you may need to complete the tutorial.<br>
Assets can be downloaded from links, or you can find all the assets in the /Assets folder of this guide, if you downloaded the guide. <br>
All tutorials will be using <b>Visual Studio</b>, but you can use any IDE with Monogame support.<br><br>
Sometimes code will be displayed in a tutorial. It looks like this:<br>
