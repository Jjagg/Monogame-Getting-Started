<h1>Making The Game Fullscreen</h1>
<p>
There are 3 options for making a game fullscreen.<br>
<br>
One option is using the graphicsManager's built in fullscreen functionality.<br>
Another option is to allow window resizing, so the player can press the fullscreen button on the game window.<br>
Another option is to match the game window's size to the user's screen size.<br>
<br>
Each option has it's own set of pros and cons, discussed below.<br>
It's likely that you will use a combination of these options, based on your needs.<br>
<b>Note</b>: these code examples refer to Game1.Initialize().<br>
</p>








<br><br>
<h3>Option 1 - Use graphics.ToggleFullScreen()</h3>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	graphics.ToggleFullScreen();
	graphics.ApplyChanges();
}
</textarea>
<p>
<b>Pros</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Your game will be stretched to match the user's screen resolution.</li>
  <li>No additional code is necessary to ensure your game displays fullscreen.</li>
</ul> 
<br>

<b>Cons</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>If the ratio of your game window doesn't match the user's display ratio, your game will appear distorted.</li>
  <li>You don't have control over how your game will be displayed across different resolutions.</li>
  <li>Textures and Fonts will be stretched as well, usually with blurry results.</li>
  <li>By default the game window's titlebar will be hidden.</li>
</ul> 
<br>

</p>






<br><br><br><br>






<h3>Option 2 - Allow Resizing</h3>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	Window.AllowUserResizing = true;
}
</textarea>
<p>
<b>Pros</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Your game window can be resized to match the user's max display resolution.</li>
  <li>Your game window can be resized to meet the user's preferences.</li>
</ul> 
<br>

<b>Cons</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Technically, not fullscreen.</li>
  <li>Your game can be displayed at wildly different aspect ratios.</li>
  <li>Consider that the user could resize the window to a vertical portrait mode.</li>
  <li>Or the window could be resized to a very wide and narrow cinema aspect ratio.</li>
  <li>This means you have to program your game's UI to function in these uncommon aspect ratios.</li>
  <li>The window's titlebar <b>must</b> be displayed as well, otherwise the user can't resize or fullscreen the game.</li>
  <li>However, you can programmatically set the minimum and maximum resolutions your game window can be resized to.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
</p>

<h3>Option 3 - Match the User's Display</h3>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();

	int displayWidth = GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.CurrentDisplayMode.Width;
	int displayHeight = GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.CurrentDisplayMode.Height;
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = displayWidth;
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = displayHeight;

	this.IsMouseVisible = true;
	Window.IsBorderless = true;
	graphics.ApplyChanges();
}
</textarea>
<p>
<b>Pros</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>The game starts fullscreen, without any border or title bar.</li>
  <li>The "professional" option.</li>
</ul> 
<br>

<b>Cons</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>You'll still need to consider how your game displays at uncommon resolutions.</li>
  <li>You <b>should</b> provide a way to exit the game.</li>
  <li>The game cannot be resized by the user.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In this article we looked at several ways to make your game display fullscreen.<br>
<br>
You'll probably use a combination of Option2 and Option3 to allow control over the game window.<br>
Option1 can lead to unpredictable scaling, which can make your game look bad.<br>
However, Option1 pretty much works all the time - so think of it as a last resort.<br>
