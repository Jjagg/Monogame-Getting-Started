<h1>Changing a UWP App's Theme</h1>


<p>
This article discusses how to change the Theme for a UWP app.<br>
The theme sets a variety of colors, including the window's background color.<br>
We'll do this by changing the App's RequestedTheme to <b>Light</b> or <b>Dark</b>.<br>

</p>



<p>
Open your <b>App.xaml</b> file.<br>
</p>

<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/UWPwindowColor.jpg" ></center>
<br><br>

<p>
Notice the line <b>RequestedTheme="Dark"</b>.<br>
There are two themes available by default, light and dark.<br>
You can learn more about these two Themes

<br>
Light means your window will have a white background.<br>
Dark means your window will have a black background.<br>
If you'd like to use a custom theme for your UWP App, you can learn about how to do that
