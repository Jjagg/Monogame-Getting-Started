<h1>Setting a UWP App's Window Size</h1>


<p>
This article discusses how to set the window (and frame) for a UWP App.<br>
You may of noticed that UWP apps don't respond to the traditional Monogame way of setting the window's size.<br>
We'll talk about why that happens, and how you can work around it.<br>
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Windows and Frames</h3>
<p>
First we need to discuss the difference between what a Window and a Frame is, in the context of a UWP App.<br>
<br>
A <b>Window</b> represents the re-sizable window the UWP App is currently running in.<br>
A <b>Frame</b> represents a rectangle that your game is rendered to, inside of that Window.<br>
By default the Frame is set to the same size as the Window, and scales to meet the Window's size.<br>
Below shows a visual representation of the App Window and App Frame.<br>
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Window Re-sizing can't be Disabled</h3>
<p>
Unlike DirectX or OpenGL projects, UWP Apps do not allow the programmer to disable window re-sizing.<br>
UWP apps are expected to work across many devices and resolutions, which requires re-sizing the window.<br>
You cannot prevent the user from re-sizing the UWP App's window, but you can control the size of your game's frame.<br>
</p>




<br><br>
<h3>Setting the Frame and Window Size</h3>
<p>
Locate the <b>App.xaml.cs</b> file in your project.<br>
Navigate to the <b>OnLaunched()</b> function.<br>
This is where we'll add code to control the size of the Frame and Window upon launch.<br>
Inspect the code below, and integrate it into your function where appropriate.<br>
<br>
<textarea rows="20" readonly>
Frame rootFrame = Window.Current.Content as Frame;

if (rootFrame == null)
{
	rootFrame = new Frame();

	rootFrame.Width = 1280;
	rootFrame.Height = 720;
	ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchViewSize = new Size(1280, 720);
	ApplicationView.PreferredLaunchWindowingMode = ApplicationViewWindowingMode.PreferredLaunchViewSize;

	rootFrame.NavigationFailed += OnNavigationFailed;
	if (e.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated) { }
	Window.Current.Content = rootFrame;
}
</textarea>
<br><br>
In this code, we set the Window and Frame to a resolution of 1280 by 720.<br>
</p>







<br><br>
<h3>Resizing Behavior</h3>
<p>
If the window is made smaller than the frame, the frame anchors to the top left corner.<br>
If the window is made larger than the frame, the frame automatically centers to the window.<br>
You may want to dynamically change the size of the frame, based on the size of the window.<br>
There are a variety of ways to do this, all of which are beyond the scope of this tutorial.<br>
<br>
It's suggested that you match the window and frame size to the user's screen resolution.<br>
This type of full screen approach is discussed in the article
