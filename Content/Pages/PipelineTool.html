<h1>What is the Pipeline Tool?</h1>
<p>
Monogame's Pipeline Tool is a program that converts game assets to XNB files.<br>
For example, the pipeline tool could convert your Hero PNG texture to a XNB file, which Monogame could then load.
<br><br>
The pipeline tool also creates .mgcb files, which are linked to Monogame projects and manage the building of game content.<br>
When you create a Monogame from a template project, a .mgcb file is automatically added.<br>
Double clicking or launching this .mgcb file will open the pipeline tool and allow you to add, remove, or modify your game content.<br>
<br>
<b>You do not need to manually copy game content into your content folder.</b>
<br>
Previously, XNA required that you copy content and then manually add it to your project.<br>
This is no longer required, as the pipeline tool will handle that for you.<br>
The pipeline tool was created and is developed by the Monogame team.<br>

<h3>What file formats are supported?</h3>
<p>
The Pipeline Tool can convert many formats into XNB.<br>
Here is an incomplete list of all the formats supported:<br>
<br>
<b>Textures:</b> png, jpg, dds, etc...<br>
<b>Sounds:</b> wav, ogg, mp3, aiff<br>
<b>3D Meshes:</b> fbx, obj<br>
<b>Fonts:</b> TrueType, SpriteFonts(BMP)<br>
<b>Data:</b> XML documents<br>
<b>Effects:</b> Effects, SpriteEffects<br>
</p>




<br><br>
<h3>My file format isn't supported...</h3>
<p>
If you have an unsupported format, it is recommended that you convert it to a supported format.<br>
If this is impossible, then you will need to write a custom content importer for Monogame.<br>
Such a process is beyond the scope of this "Getting Started" documentation.<br>
You should refer to the Monogame community for advice on how to proceed.<br>
