<h1>What is the Content Pipeline?</h1>
<p>
The content pipeline refers to the process by which a game asset is transformed into the XNB format.<br>
For example, a texture could start out as a PNG file, but it will get transformed into an XNB for Monogame.<br>
MonoGame implements its own content pipeline for transforming your unoptimized assets into platform optimized content.<br>
This is critical in building a game which runs as fast as possible under tight resource constraints.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>What is an XNB?</h3>
<p>
The acronym XNB stands for Xbox Binary.<br>
The full name for an XNB is a XNA Game Studio Express XNA Framework Content Pipeline Binary file.<br>
An XNB is a compressed proprietary file format used to store textures, sounds, fonts, or other game assets.<br>
Think of an XNB as the compressed and compiled version of your game asset.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>Why XNBs?</h3>
<p>
Monogame was born from XNA, and XNA loaded game assets in the XNB format.<br>
So, Monogame uses XNB because XNA did. This makes it easier to port XNA games to Monogame.<br>
XNBs also load quickly and are stored in a compressed format, making them ideal for game assets.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>Can I load other file formats instead of XNBs?</h3>
<p>
Yes, you can, but support is limited and Monogame is moving away from supporting non-XNB files.<br>
Monogame prefers creating XNB files from your game content.<br>
This allows Monogame to transform your unoptimized assets into platform optimized content.<br>
It's preferred that you load XNBs and use the Monogame Pipeline Tool to handle conversion of assets to XNBs.<br>
