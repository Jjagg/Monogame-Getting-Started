<h1>Limits applied to XBox One UWP Apps</h1>


<p>
This section discusses the various limits applied to UWP apps running on an Xbox One.<br>
UWP apps and games running on Xbox One share resources with the system and other apps.<br>
The information presented here is duplicated from the 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/system-resource-allocation">official documentation</a>.
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Memory Limits</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The maximum memory available to an app running in the foreground is 1 GB.</li>
  <li>The maximum memory available to an app running in the background is 128 MB.</li>
  <li>Apps that exceed these memory requirements will encounter memory allocation failures.</li>
</ul> 
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>CPU + GPU Limits</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Share of 2-4 CPU cores depending on the number of apps and games running on the system.</li>
  <li>Share of 45% of the GPU depending on the number of apps and games running on the system.</li>
  <li>All apps must target the x64 architecture in order to be developed or submitted to the store for Xbox.</li>
</ul> 
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
<p>
UWP on Xbox One supports DirectX 11 Feature Level 10. DirectX 12 is not supported at this time.<br>
If you are working on a game that requires DirectX 12, you can register with the ID@Xbox program.<br>
This gets you access to Xbox One development kits, which include DirectX 12 support.<br>
