<h1>RescueDog's Classes</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will inspect the classes that compose RescueDog's codebase.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>Index of Classes</h3>
<p>
A significant amount of information is presented on this page.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3 >Class Definitions</h3>
<p>
In the sections below, each class is described in detail.<br>
To better navigate this amount of data, please use the links in the Index section above.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Actor">Actor.cs</h3>
<p>
The Actor class represents an animated, mobile entity in the game.<br>
<br>
Each Actor checks their collision rectangle against the level's walls, ensuring they stay within level bounds.<br>
Actors have collision rectangle offsets, which allows an actor's collision rec to be positioned lower or higher than the sprite.<br>
This allows actors to walk closer to walls, or even under some walls, giving the illusion of depth.<br>
<br>
Actors have animations, which are lists of Points that correspond to frames in the game's sprite sheet.<br>
This animation list approach allows an actor to have different frames easily play in sequence.<br>
Actors can have several idle animations, bringing some life to the character instead of just standing still.<br>
<br>
Actors are defined by their Type enumerator. This is in contrast to seperating actors into their own classes.<br>
They could be seperated into their own classes, and should be if there were going to be many actors.<br>
Because there are only 3 actors, I decided to just keep them all in one class to keep it simple.<br>
<br>
An actor accepts an InputState in their HandleInput() method.<br>
InputHelper maps player input to an InputState, then passes this state to the Dog Actor.<br>
This allows the user to control the dog. GameManager also passes an InputState to the Human and Spiders.<br>
This means the game's AI is simulating controller/keyboard input to move and control the NPCs.<br>
This makes it easy to swap human and computer control, and makes actor input generalized to an InputState.<br>
This allows InputHelper to map keyboard/controller input to an InputState, instead of passing keyboard or gamepad state.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="BootScreen">BootScreen.cs</h3>
<p>
BootScreen is the first screen that is displayed when the game is launched in release mode.<br>
Release mode can be set in Game1.cs.<br>
<br>
BootScreen loads and displays a centered MonoGame logo, then fades out and loads a GameScreen.<br>
BootScreen uses an enumerator to track screen state. <br>
This allows the screen to know when it's opening, opened, closing, and closed.<br>
The screen performs different functions during each state.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Button">Button.cs</h3>
<p>
A Button has a background rectangle and a foreground text object.<br>
This represents a user interface button that the user could hover over and click on.<br>
Buttons are used in the Editor to allow developer input.<br>
<br>
Button uses an enumerator to track it's state.<br>
A Button can have the states of Up, Over, and Down - depending on the cursor and user's input.<br>
Buttons can also be selected or unselected.<br>
Based on a button's state and selected boolean, the background rectangle will draw at different colors.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Camera2D">Camera2D.cs</h3>
<p>
Camera2D represents a 2 dimensional camera that can pan on the X and Y axis.<br>
The camera isn't constructed to handle any movement on the Z axis, but it can zoom in and out.<br>
This allows the camera to get closer or further away from the game world.<br>
<br>
The camera has a position and a target position.<br>
The camera will move towards the target position quickly, but will slow down as it gets closer.<br>
This allows the camera to have a panning movement that is smooth and natural.<br>
The camera also has functions for converting a point in screen space to a point in world space, and vice verse.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Editor">Editor.cs</h3>
<p>
Editor allows Developer input for the game via Buttons displayed in a menu bar anchored to the top of the viewport.<br>
Editor can be hidden or disabled, based the game's release boolean. This locks out players from developer options.<br>
<br>
We can simulate release mode via the PlayTest button. We can end PlayTest mode by pressing the Enter key.<br>
We can draw the collision rectangles of all actors and objects via the DrawDebug button.<br>
We can save and load level data via the Save and Load buttons.<br>
We can generate a new cave level via the New button.<br>
Finally, we can unlocko the camera from the hero dog via the Roam button.<br>
When the camera is unlocked we can pan the camera by holding down the spacebar and click-dragging the cursor.<br>
We can also zoom in and out using Ctrl and + or - keys.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Game1">Game1.cs</h3>
<p>
Game1 is our main game class, and is used primarily as a location for assets that all screens can use.<br>
It is also the entry point for our game, after program.cs. <br>
This is where we assign the first screen the game will use.<br>
<br>
In release mode, Game1 assigns a BootScreen first.<br>
In developer mode, Game1 assigns a GameScreen first.<br>
This is done so we as developers dont have to sit through a boot screen just to test the game.<br>
<br>
Game1 also defines some colors specific to the game, along with loading some textures and fonts.<br>
Every screen will use these textures and fonts, so it doesn't make sense to reload this assets per screen.<br>
Instead they are loaded once when the game runs, then screens reference these assets when they need to.<br>
<br>
Game1 also creates an instance of SoundManager, which loads all the game's sounds.<br>
This makes SoundManager and the game's sounds function in parallel to any screen being displayed.<br>
This allows music to continue playing even when a screen is exiting or loading.<br>
This also allows screens to interact with the game's sounds easily, and removes a screens need to load any sounds.<br>
<br>
Finally, Game1 creates an instance of ScreenManager, which handles all Loading, Unloading, Updating, and Drawing of screens.<br>
This is how we manage the game's state.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="GameManager">GameManager.cs</h3>
<p>
GameManager handles aspects of the game that don't necessarily fit into other classes.<br>
This class can be thought of as a collection of methods that ensure the game functions correctly.<br>
It's best described as the game's AI, even though theres nothing intelligent about it.<br>
<br>
GameManager handles the Human and Spider's movements and actions.<br>
GM checks to see if the player has beaten the level, or if the player has lost the game.<br>
GM also manages the dog's bark recangle, and checks for collisions between spiders and the bark rectangle.<br>
This check is what causes the spiders to jump away from the dog when the dog barks.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="GameObject">GameObject.cs</h3>
<p>
The GameObject class represents immobile, animated objects that exist in a level.<br>
For example, the animated fire is a game object. But the fire's torch is also a game object.<br>
In addition, the exit is a game object - along with the holes in the walls.<br>
<br>
A game object has a collision rectangle, and can be used in collision checking.<br>
This is how GameManager knows if a Human has reached the level's exit.<br>
The GM can check the human's collision rectangle to see if it intersects with the exit's collision recangle.<br>
<br>
Game Objects are similar to Actors in that they both have animation lists.<br>
But a Game Object only has 1 animation list, and it continually loops.<br>
If a Game Object doens't have an animation, then there is only 1 frame in the animation list.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="GameScreen">GameScreen.cs</h3>
<p>
The GameScreen is the screen that displays the cave level, the hero dog and human, and the game's logo.<br>
This is where the user inputs commands from the keyboard and controller to actually play the game.<br>
Because GameScreen is where all input, updates, and draws happen - it can be a little complicated.<br>
<br>
Most of the game functionality is split into classes that each have their own responsibility.<br>
GameScreen is where all these classes live together in harmony, communicating with each other through GameScreen.<br>
In this way, GameScreen is like a connection between each class.<br>
Instead of storing connections to all the other classes, a class only needs to store a connection to GameScreen.<br>
Then that class can communicate with all the other classes by using the GameScreen reference.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="InputHelper">InputHelper.cs</h3>
<p>
InputHelper maps Mouse, Keyboard, and Controller input to an InputState that is then passed to other classes.<br>
This means we could add additional controllers later on, and map those controllers to an InputState.<br>
Because all input is mapped to an InputState, we don't need to pass keyboard or controller specific states to other classes.<br>
Classes only need to know about InputState.<br>
<br>
InputHelper also has several functions to make it easier to check button or key states.<br>
There are functions to see if a key/button was pressed this frame, released this frame, or is being held down this frame.<br>
Theres also a method to investigate a connected controller's functionality to see if it's compatible.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Level">Level.cs</h3>
<p>
The Level class contains all the data that describes a level.<br>
This is composed of 5 lists: floor sprites, debris sprites, wall objects, game objects, and actors.<br>
There is also a rooms list, but it's not really used for anything.<br>
<br>
The Level class has a method for sorting the level, which assigns a layer to each sprite based on it's Y position.<br>
This allows some walls to be displayed behind actors, while other walls are displayed in front of actors.<br>
<br>
The Level class also contains a method for culling sprites based on a rectangle.<br>
GameScreen passes the camera's view rectangle to this method.<br>
Using this rectangle, the method hides level sprites that fall outside of the viewing area.<br>
Level also has the standard Update and Draw methods.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="LevelGenerator">LevelGenerator.cs</h3>
<p>
Level Generator is responsible for creating cave levels that are solvable.<br>
Solvable is defined as traversable from the spawn to the exit via 1 or more critical paths.<br>
A flood fill algorithm is used to ensure each level is solvable.<br>
<br>
Level Generator contains several methods that work together to create an interesting maze-like level.<br>
This is accomplished using a tile list, and many rectangles.<br>
To check that LevelGenerator is working correctly, you can enable it's Draw() method.<br>
<br>
Functions worth mentioning include the BuildWalls() method.<br>
This method creates and places walls around tiles based on the tile's neighbors.<br>
This method allows LevelGenerator to seperate connecting tiles and building walls.<br>
Once enough tiles have been connected together, then walls are built.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Program">Program.cs</h3>
<p>
Program.cs is where the game starts. <br>
Program.cs creates an instance of Game1 and starts running it.<br>
There's not much to say about Program.cs.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Room">Room.cs</h3>
<p>
The Room class describes a room in the level.<br>
Rooms are only used by LevelGenerator, and they are only used to group fill tiles.<br>
<br>
The Room class was originally designed so each room could have a purpose.<br>
You can see the start of this idea with Room's Type enumerator.<br>
Rooms can be of Type Spawn, Exit, or None - but this could be extended to support Bosses or anything else.<br>
<br>
However, this Room Type enumerator isn't used anywhere in the game.<br>
Instead Spawns and Exits are created in LevelGenerator based on individual tiles.<br>
I left the Room class in this state because I wanted to show how rooms could be used.<br>
<br>
In your game, you may want to place a boss or treasure in a specific room.<br>
The Room Type enumerator could be used to tag a room for such a purpose.<br>
Then later on you could locate the room with the tag and place the boss inside.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="SaveLoadLevel">SaveLoadLevel.cs</h3>
<p>
The SaveLoadLevel class saves and loads level data.<br>
This is done using the SaveData class, which is a serializable list of tiles.<br>
The Tile class is defined in LevelGenerator.cs.<br>
<br>
The SaveLevel method copies LevelGenerator's tileList to SaveData's tileList, then serializes it to an XML file.<br>
The LoadLevel method does the inverse, deserializing an XML file to a SaveData instance.<br>
Then the SaveData instance's tileList is copied to LevelGenerator's tileList.<br>
Finally, LevelGenerator methods are called to finish building the level from just tileList data.<br>
<br>
Note that we are not saving the locations or types of walls, gameobjects, exits or spawns.<br>
These will be randomized everytime, but the overall layout of the maze will remain the same.<br>
If you wanted to save all of a level's data, you would need to serialize sprites, walls, gameobjects and actors.<br>
This would considerably complicate the save and load methods, and increase the XML file size.<br>
For this getting started example game, I decided that would be too difficult to understand and explain.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Screen">Screen.cs</h3>
<p>
The Screen class describes the base class that all other screens inherit from.<br>
Screens have 5 basic methods that allow them to function: LoadContent, UnloadContent, HandleInput, Update, and Draw.<br>
Each of these methods serves a particular purpose.<br>
<br>
LoadContent and UnloadContent should be self explanatory - this is where content is managed.<br>
HandleInput is where user Input is checked for key presses, button presses, and mouse movement.<br>
Update is where the screen should perform any logic on the data it contains.<br>
Finally, Draw is where the screen draws it's visual elements to the viewport.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="ScreenManager">ScreenManager.cs</h3>
<p>
The ScreenManager class works in conjunction with the Screen class to manage game state.<br>
ScreenManager handles the loading, unloading, input, update, and draw methods of every screen added to the screens list.<br>
Game1.cs creates a ScreenManager instance and passes it's Update and Draw methods to ScreenManager.<br>
In turn, ScreenManager passes those Update and Draw calls to screens on the screen list.<br>
<br>
ScreenManager also creates an InputHelper instance, allowing ScreenManager to pass input to each screen.<br>
Finally, ScreenManager has methods for adding, removing, and exiting screens, which can be called by screens. <br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="SoundManager">SoundManager.cs</h3>
<p>
The SoundManager class loads and controls all the sounds and music used in the game.<br>
Game1 creates an instance of the SoundManager class alongside an instance of the ScreenManager class.<br>
This allows sound to play seperate from any screen that is loading, displaying, unloading, or exiting.<br>
<br>
SoundManager also has methods for playing and fading of music tracks.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Sprite">Sprite.cs</h3>
<p>
The Sprite class represents a section of a texture that is drawn with a scale and opacity on a specific layer.<br>
Sprites have additional fields, like rotation and position as well.<br>
The Sprite class was created to make it easier to draw and animate sections of a texture.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Text">Text.cs</h3>
<p>
The Text class represents a string that is drawn to the viewport with a scale and opacity on a specific layer.<br>
The Text class is very similar to the Sprite class, except that it displays text instead of a texture.<br>
The Text class was created to make it easier to draw text to the viewport.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="TitleWidget">TitleWidget.cs</h3>
<p>
The TitleWidget class displays the game's logo and any information text the user should know.<br>
By information text, I'm referring to the text that displays "Level 1" or "Try Again?" or "You Won".<br>
Conveniently, all text displayed in game is displayed through this widget.<br>
In addition, all text displayed in game is located in a single sprite sheet.<br>
This makes translating the game to different languages easier, because we only need to change a spritesheet.<br>
<br>
The TitleWidget class also accepts user input, if the TitleWidget is in the Won or Lost state.<br>
The Won state leads to the WonScree, while the Lost state generates a new level to explore.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="Wall">Wall.cs</h3>
<p>
The Wall class represents an impassable, stationary object that resembles a cave wall.<br>
There are many types of walls, as described by the WallType enumerator.<br>
Walls are only created in one function, the LevelGenerator.BuildWalls() method.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3 id="WonScreen">WonScreen.cs</h3>
<p>
The WonScreen displays the dog hero and the text "Thanks for Playing!".<br>
The dog sprite animates a few times, then the screen fades out and loads the BootScreen.<br>
The WonScreen represents the "end" of the game, afterwards the game essentially restarts.<br>
</p>











<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
