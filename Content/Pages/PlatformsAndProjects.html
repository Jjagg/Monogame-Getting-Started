<h1>Platforms and Project Types</h1>

<p>







<h3>Platforms</h3>

A <b>platform</b> is a device plus it's software environment.<br>
A home PC running Windows7 is a platform. <br>
A smart phone running Android is a platform.<br>
A Playstation 4 console running Orbis OS is a platform.<br>
Monogame supports a variety of platforms.<br>
Coming soon, Monogame will even support the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://nintendoeverything.com/monogame-software-is-compatible-with-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.<br>
<br>
In order to develop for certain platforms, you may be required to download and install additional software.<br>
For example, in order to develop UWP apps/games for Xbox One, you must use Visual Studio.<br>
You must be using Windows 10 as well, and have access to an Xbox One console.<br>
In addition, you must install the Universal Windows App Development Tools.<br>
Finally, you must install the latest Windows 10 SDK.<br>
<br>


<h3>Project Types</h3>

Monogame projects can target different platforms.<br>
Different platforms require different libraries and backends to run.<br>
A <b>project type</b> tells Monogame which platform it's targeting, and the libraries it needs to use.<br>
<br>
For example, a Monogame 3.6 Desktop OpenGL project will now use SDL2 for the backend.<br>
A Monogame 3.6 Desktop OpenGL project will also use OpenAL to play sounds.<br>
You may be required to also install OpenAL to test your OpenGL project.<br>
This means that anyone who plays your game will also need OpenAL.<br>
<br>



<h3>Templates</h3>

A <b>template</b> allows an IDE to create a project targeted at a specific platform.<br>
A project is a series of files that describe the program, and let the IDE know what libraries to use.<br>
The libraries a project requires to run are also known as <b>dependencies</b>.<br>
Each project or template has different dependencies based on the platform it targets.<br>
<br>
To view the available templates, launch a supported IDE with Monogame installed.<br>
