<h1>Asset Planning</h1>
<p>In this article, we will discuss planning a game's assets.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>


<h3>What is a Game Asset?</h3>
<p>
A Game Asset refers to any model, image, texture, sound, effect, animation, or dialog used in a game.<br>
This could also include storylines, interfaces, or any other crafted item created by a human.<br>
Generally, game assets are things created by humans for use in a game.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>What Assets does the Example Game have?</h3>
<p>
The example game, RescueDog, has <b>13 game assets:</b><br>
<br>
3 sprite sheets<br>
1 image<br>
1 font<br>
3 background music tracks<br>
3 actor sound effects<br>
2 event sound effects<br>
<br>
The game's assets are displayed below. Note the monogame content pipeline tool.<br>

<h3>Planning a Game's Assets</h3>
<p>
Planning a game's assets can be a monumental task.<br>
For every actor or hero in your game you need a visual and auditory representation.<br>
Visually, this may be a model with a texture, or a sprite, or simply a text letter or number.<br>
That actor or hero also needs at least one signature sound - maybe that's just an attack sound.<br>
Maybe it's a sound for selecting the actor, for the actor dying, leveling up, etc...<br>
<br>
Each actor likely also has animations. Maybe that's just an attack animation and a walk cycle.<br>
Or maybe they can block attacks, duck and dodge, jump and climb. Each animation is an asset!<br>
And this actor likely exists in a world or level. That level will need art and level design.<br>
But you're not done yet - maybe that level also needs sound. Is it raining? Does a volcano explode?<br>
Perhaps the level also needs animation. Does that door open? Does that wall crumble?<br>
<br>
Then you must consider the assets necessary to tell the game's story - dialogs, cutscenes, images.<br>
How does the user interact with the game? Through a user interface - that needs to be designed too.<br>
How you determine and design the game's assets will have a huge effect on the game's scope.<br>
The more numerous, detailed, and varied the assets are - the more work will be required to create them.<br>
</p>

<h3>Creating The Example Game's Assets</h3>
<p>
Creating the example game's assets took a significant amount of time.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://opengameart.org/content/cave-tileset-0" >Cave tiles</a> from OpenGameArt.org were chosen for the level sprites.<br>
Each actor's sound effect was created using the tool <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bfxr.net/" >BFXR</a>.<br>
<br>
Photoshop was used to create and pack the game's two main sprite sheets.<br>
Each actor was limited to an animation facing one direction. <br>
Then the sprite was flipped horizontally when the actor moved the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the actor and level sprite sheet the game uses:<br>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
We discussed what Game Assets are and explored the assets in the example game, RescueDog.<br>
You should have an understanding of how to plan a game's assets.
