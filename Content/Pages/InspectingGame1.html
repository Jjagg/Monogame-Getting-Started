<h1>Inspecting Game1.cs</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will inspect the Game1.cs class. <br>
This article assumes that you have already <a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Built A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>Open Game1.cs in the Editor</h3>
<p>
Double click on Game1.cs in the solution explorer.
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/game1Class.jpg" ></center>
<br><br>

<p>
This displays the Game1 class in the editor:
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/editingGame1.jpg" ></center>
<br><br>


<p>
Let's look at some of Game1's code:
</p>


<textarea rows="8" readonly>
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;

namespace Game1
{
    public class Game1 : Game
    {
</textarea>


<p>
First, Game1 requires some things to run properly, so we have <b>using statements</b> that include the XNA framework, graphics, and input.<br>
Then we tell the game which <b>namespace</b> it exists in. <br>
We see Game1 <b>inherits</b> from the class of Game from the line:<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="3" readonly>
public class Game1 : Game
</textarea>


<p>
So, Game is known as the <b>base class</b> of Game1. <br>
Game1 <b>extends</b> the class of Game with it's own functionality. <br>
<br>
In order for Game1 to have it's own unique functionality, Game1 must overwrite some of game's methods. <br>
Game defines the methods <b>Initialize(), LoadContent(), UnloadContent(), Update(), and Draw()</b>. <br>
Game1 will overwrite each of these methods with it's own methods. <br>
Let's look at the first method, labeled Game1():<br>
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Inspect The Constructor</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
public Game1()
{
	graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);
	Content.RootDirectory = "Content";
}
</textarea>

<p>
This method is known as a <b>constructor</b>.
The constructor method is called when a class is <b>instantiated</b>.<br>
Instantiation occurs when an instance of the class is created using the <b>new</b> keyword.<br>
<br>
In this constructor, the graphics device manager is set and the content root directory is set.<br>
The game needs a graphics device manger to draw things to the game window.<br>
Monogame communicates with the graphical backend through the graphics device manager.<br>
<br>
The game also needs to know where to look for game assets, like textures, meshes, sounds, and fonts.<br>
The line <i>Content.RootDirectory = "Content";</i> tells the game to look in the Content folder.<br>
<br>
If you look in the solution explorer window, you can see that your game has a Content folder.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<center><img src="../Assets/contentFolder.jpg" ></center>
<br><br><br><br>









<h3>Inspect Initialize()</h3>
<p>	
Initialize is called once, after the game class is constructed.<br>
Think of this as the game starting up. Notice the term <b>override</b> in this line:<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="3" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
</textarea>	
<p>
Override in C# means that this class (Game1) is over writing the base class' initialize method.<br>
Think of it like this: Game.Initialize() is overwritten by Game1.Initialize().<br>
Game defines what a 'game' is. Game1 is your game, and you get to define what you want it to be.<br>
For example, here we can set the size of the game window like this:<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1280;
	graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 720;
}
</textarea>	
<p>
Or we could show/hide the mouse cursor, and allow the user to resize the game window:
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	this.IsMouseVisible = true;
	Window.AllowUserResizing = true;
}
</textarea>	
<p>
Go ahead and rename your game window to "MyFirstGame":
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Initialize()
{
	base.Initialize();
	Window.Title = "My First Game";
}
</textarea>	
<p>Run your game and see the changes.</p>	
<br><br><br><br>








	
<h3>Inspect LoadContent()</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void LoadContent()
{
	spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);
}
</textarea>	
<p>		
Load content is called once, after initialize. This is where the game expects to load assets from the Content folder.<br>
Here the game creates a new spriteBatch. A <b>SpriteBatch</b> is used to draw textures and fonts to the game window.<br> 
We explore the SpriteBatch in the <a href="SpriteBatchClass.html" target="display">SpriteBatch Class article</a>.<br>
</p>	
<br><br><br><br>

	
	
	
	
	
	
<h3>Inspect UnloadContent()</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void UnloadContent()
{
	// TODO: Unload any non ContentManager content here
}
</textarea>	
<p>		
Note that this method is empty and essentially does nothing right now.<br>
That's because we haven't loaded any content - so there's nothing to unload.<br>
Later on when you have loaded content and you need to unload it, you might use this method to do so.<br>
You may instead choose to create a dedicated class to manage content loading and unloading.<br>
This is commonly done in larger games where there are many assets to be managed.<br>
<br>
Let's move on to the two most important methods, <b>Update()</b> and <b>Draw()</b>.<br>
</p>	
<br><br><br><br>









<h3>Inspect Update()</h3>
<textarea rows="10" readonly>
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
	if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed || Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))
		Exit();
	base.Update(gameTime);
}
</textarea>	
<p>	
The update method is called every frame your game runs.<br>
If you've heard of the term "60 frames per second" then you know what a frame is.<br>
For a game running at 60 frames per second, <b>Update() is called every 16ms</b>.<br>
By default, Monogame runs at 60 frames per second - but this can be changed.<br>
<br>
Update() methods are commonly used to track, inspect, change, and calculate game data or state.<br>
If you inspect this method you see the first line of code contains an if statement that reads input.<br>
In this case, input and update code exist in the same method.<br>
It is common to seperate input and update code into different methods.<br>
<br>
Let's inspect the if statement in update():<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed || Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))
	Exit();
</textarea>	
<p>
Here you can see the game getting the input state of any attached gamepad or keyboard.<br>
Then the state is checked to see if the user is pressing the gamepad's back button or keyboard's escape key.<br>
Either input triggers the <b>Exit()</b> method, which exits the game and closes the game window.<br>
<br>
Notice the code <i>PlayerIndex.One</i>. <br>
The game is getting input from the gamepad controller associated with PlayerIndex.One.<br>
This is usually the gamepad that was plugged in first.<br>
The gamepad plugged in second would be associated with PlayerIndex.Two.<br>
You could target player 2's controller using the code <i>PlayerIndex.Two</i>.<br>
</p>	
<br><br><br><br>








<h3>Inspect Draw()</h3>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
	GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);
	base.Draw(gameTime);
}
</textarea>	
<p>		
Draw() is called each frame, just like Update().<br>
However, Draw() is called <b>after</b> Update().<br>
So in terms of execution, each frame your game calls Update(), then Draw().<br>
At 60 frames per second, this means <b>every 16ms both Update() and Draw() are called</b>.<br>
<br>
Divided evenly, this means Update() and Draw() each have 8ms to complete their work.<br>
Because of time constraints like 16ms, the Update and Draw methods should be kept as fast as possible.<br>
By default Monogame runs at 60 frames per second, or 16ms each frame.<br>
If Update and Draw take less than 16ms to finish, Monogame will wait until the next frame should be called.<br>
<br>
So what does draw actually do?<br>
Well, <b>draw is where the game should draw textures, sprites, images, meshes, and text to the screen</b>.<br>
Let's change the background color to something else, like black:<br>

</p>
<textarea rows="4" readonly>
GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);
</textarea>	
<br><br>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
And that's it! You should now have a solid understanding of how the game class operates.<br>
We learned how to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>change the size of the game window</li>
  <li>show or hide the mouse cursor</li>
  <li>disable or allow resizing of the game window</li>
  <li>rename the game window</li>
  <li>change the background color of your game</li>
</ul>
