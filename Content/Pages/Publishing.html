<h1>Publishing</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will discuss publishing a completed game.<br>
Let's get started.
</p>
<br>


<h3>What is Publishing?</h3>
<p>
Publishing is the process of selling or sharing your game with others.<br>
There are many approaches to publishing.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to share your game with others is to <b>package it into an archive</b>.<br>
You'll need to make sure you include your game's dependencies, if you legally can.<br>
Sometimes you cannot legally redistribute a dependency because of it's license.<br>
It's important to know the licensing of the libraries your game requires.<br>
Once you have created an archive you can then post it to a game marketplace, like <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>.<br>
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Selling Your Game</h3>
<p>
If you want to sell your game, you'll have to consider many things:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Forming a Business and Paying Taxes</li>
  <li>Copyrighting your Game, Artwork, Sounds, and Logos</li>
  <li>Preventing or Discouraging Piracy</li>
  <li>Promotion and Advertising</li>
  <li>Installation and Support</li>
</ul> 
<br>
All of these topics are outside of the scope for a Getting Started Guide.<br>
They are included here to introduce you to the realities of selling a game.<br>
Sharing a game for free is relatively easy and straight forward.<br>
Selling a game can be a very complicated, expensive, and dangerous process.<br>
You should hire legal consultation prior to selling a game or forming a business.<br>
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
<p>
Determining the hardware requirements for your game can be challenging.<br>
If you are developing for a console, then you know the hardware the game will run on.<br>
If you're developing for desktops or smart phones, the hardware may be old, new, or simply incompatible.<br>
It's very difficult to ensure that your game will run on unknown hardware or software.<br>
Therefore you should provide a list of recommended hardware & software that your game is known to run on.<br>
It's also a good idea to have a website that lists known bugs or errors, so users can get help if they need to.<br>
<br>
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>When Things Break</h3>
<p>
In an ideal world, your game installs and runs without issue, and everyone loves it.<br>
However we live in reality, and <b>in reality there are always problems and bugs with software</b>.<br>
When there is a problem with a piece of software, it frustrates people.<br>
When something frustrates a person, they start to dislike it.<br>
These frustrated people are more likely to search for, and talk about, their problems online.<br>
And frustrated people, who spent money on a non-functioning product, can be mean.<br>
Let's hope you never experience this, or worse yet - have to deal with it.<br>
<br>
When things break, someone has to fix them. If you're a single developer, that person is you.<br>
For this section, I'm going to assume you are the person who has to fix the problem.<br>
I'm going to provide a series of actions that you should take.<br>
<br>
<b>The first thing you should do is clearly communicate that someone is looking into the problem.</b><br>
Do not leave players, or customers, in the dark about what's going on.<br>
This makes them feel ignored, which amplifies their belief that the devs only care about their money.<br>
You should also provide frequent updates about your progress resolving the problem.<br>
This doesn't have to be an article or blog post, just a simple tweet will do.<br>
<br>
<b>The second thing you should do is collect as much information about the problem as you can.</b><br>
It's a good idea to have an alpha + beta test prior to release.<br>
The reality is that indie devs can't always afford this, or may be working under tight deadlines.<br>
The alternative is to embed debugging tools into the game that write or send crash reports.<br>
You should assume that any information a player gives you has been tainted in some way.<br>
They may think of themselves as genuises and 'solve' the issue, without really understanding the problem.<br>
Their opinions are of little value - you need to collect as much hard, objective data as you can.<br>
<br>
<b>Third - you should understand and reproduce the problem, based on the information available.</b><br>
Don't worry about solving it right now. You should focus on fully understanding the problem.<br>
If you can't reproduce the problem, then you can't check to see if you've actually solved it.<br>
If you don't understand the problem, then your solution isn't going to fix it.<br>
<br>
<b>Fourth - you should implement a solution.</b><br>
Apply the patch, then test that the problem has been resolved by attempting to reproduce it. <br>
If your solution fixes the problem, then you need to push out the patch to your game.<br>
On some platforms and marketplaces, patches or updates can cost alot of money.<br>
Financially speaking, it may not be worth fixing a small bug if it costs alot to patch.<br>
Or you may want to wait and release an update that patches multiple bugs.<br>
<br>
<b>Finally, you should document the problem and solution, and notify affected players.</b><br>
It's likely that your solution is hacky or brittle - and that's just the nature of patching complex systems.<br>
In the future, if additional work is done to the game's codebase, your patch will likely break.<br>
At this point, it's good to have documentation to refer to when understanding a new problem.<br>
This documentation will likely reduce how long it takes to understand the new problem.<br>
Affected players will appreciate being notified that their particular problem was fixed.<br>
It makes them feel like they were a part of the process, and that their voice mattered.<br>
</p>



<br><br>
<h3>The Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>
If you're lucky, you'll never get here.<br>
But for some indie devs, certain things can happen that they are unable to deal with.<br>
Getting sued by a large corporation, for example, will end most indie studios overnight.<br>
Unless you have the money for legal fees and a lengthy trial, you're done.<br>
This is an example of a "Worst Case Scenario", and you should have a plan for it.<br>
<br>
If you're reading this, hopefully you're not in a "Worst Case Scenario".<br>
Instead, you're probably just getting into game development.<br>
So think of this section as an introduction on how to avoid these "Worst Case Scenarios".<br>
<br>
The vast majority of WCSs stem from a lack of understanding or research.<br>
For example, prior to releasing a game in China, you should do some research on their culture.<br>
Aspects of your game may not be culturally appropriate and there could be serious consequences.<br>
<br>
Alot of WCSs also come from copyright violation or improper use of an asset's license.<br>
You should understand the licenses attached to the assets you are using.<br>
If you have created your own assets then you're probably safe.<br>
It's a good idea to patent, trademark, or copyright unique intellectual property.<br>
You should also check to see if any assets you are using are legally protected by copyright.<br>
<br>
Other WCSs can arise from hiring people to work on or promote your game.<br>
You should always secure written agreements between employees or independent contractors.<br>
Always, always, always do this. If your game starts making good money, they will want a piece.<br>
A written agreement prevents them from claiming more than they are owed.<br>
It also entitles them to what they are owed - so it keeps everyone honest.<br>
<br>
The most common WCS is bankruptcy or dissolution.<br>
Most businesses fail. Almost all businesses lose money for the first few years of operation.<br>
If you don't have enough money to pay the bills and employees, then get loans or sell.<br>
If you can't get loans due to bad credit, then you'll likely have to dissolve the business.<br>
Don't be unaware of this process - it can ruin you financially.<br>
<br>
This section may seem to be beyond the scope for a getting started guide, but it's not.<br>
Most game developers are ignorant of the law, and are frequently taken advantage of.<br>
By introducing you to these concepts early on, I hope to make you aware of the pitfalls you may face.<br>
I would contend that knowing your legal rights and obligations is just as important as development.<br>
<b>If you want to make money developing games, you need to know the law.</b><br>
