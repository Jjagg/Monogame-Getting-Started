In this article, we will discuss game design and game scope.

Let's get started.


### What is Game Design?


**Game Design** refers to the process of planning the content, rules, and gameplay of a game.

You make choices about the type of art and sound the game will use.

You will decide how the user controls and interacts with the game.

You plan the rules and conditions of winning, losing, and progressing.


Game Design is not a simple topic that can be described in a few sentences.

In fact, Game Design can mean different things to different people.


One person may focus on the characters and their stories, and the game's story.

While another person may focus on the art and sound and experience of the game.

Another person may focus on how the art and sound is programmed and interacted with.

All of these people are designing aspects of a game.


### Managing Game Design


As an indie developer, with a small team and small budget, it can be hard to manage a game's design.

It is advisable that you start small, finish fast, then build upon those successes.

After a few projects you will start to understand what's possible and how to design better.

Keep in mind that it's all a learning experience - sometimes the most valuable knowledge comes from failure.


### What is Game Scope?


The term **Scope** refers to the features and functionality that your game will have.

It's suggested that you limit the scope of your games as much as possible.

Why would you want to limit your game? Because **a game without limits never gets finished.**

Scope is also the discipline of removing game mechanics that don't support the core gameplay.


Generally as scope increases, so does the amount of work necessary to complete the game.

And while some ideas sound cool at first, they can be implemented poorly, or just don't fit.

Managing scope is hard to do. Even big companies with big budgets often manage a game's scope poorly.


### Managing Game Scope


**As an indie developer, you must be wary not to get caught in the trap of ever expanding scope.**

Scrape away features and functionality until only the core gameplay remains.

You may also want to simplify the core gameplay down to the essentials.

Scope is best managed by creating a clear **Game Design Document**.


### Game Design Document


A Game Design Document attempts to describe every aspect of a game project, including:


- gameplay
- art
- level design
- story
- characters
- user interface
- assets
- target audience
- sound, music
- game controls


Game Design Documents are used to organize effort during development.

A GDD should be made in the pre-production stage of development, prior to codebase creation.

GDDs often start as conceptual and incomplete, and are changed as development happens.

There is no standard GDD template to follow. The structure and content is up to you.


### Summary


You should now have an understanding of what game design and scope is.
