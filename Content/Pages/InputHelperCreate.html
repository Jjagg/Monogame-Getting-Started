<h1>Creating InputHelper.cs</h1>


<p>In this article, we will create a new class to handle the user's input.<br>
This article assumes that you have already <a href="BuildingFirstProject.html" target="display">Built A MonoGame Project</a>.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>











<h3>Why Should Input be In It's Own Class?</h3>
<p>
When you first create a new MonoGame project, you will notice Game1.cs has Input being checked in Update().<br>
While this is technically acceptable, as your project grows your Input checking code will likely grow as well.<br>
Your Update() method will become more complex too. It's a good idea to seperate Input from Update().<br>
<br>
To do this, we are going to create a new class called InputHelper.<br>
The responsibility of InputHelper will be to provide the Game with useful information about the mouse and keyboard.<br>
We will then create an instance of InputHelper in Game, and then check user input through InputHelper.<br>
This seperates Input logic from Update logic, and makes your game easier to understand.<br>
</p>











<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Creating InputHelper.cs</h3>
<p>
Add a new class to your project name "InputHelper.cs".<br>
Refer to the <a href="CreateAClass.html" target="display">Creating A Class</a> article if you are unfamiliar with this process.<br>
Open InputHelper.cs in the Editor and replace it's code with the code below.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="95" readonly>
using System;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;

namespace Game1
{
    public enum MouseButtons { LeftButton, RightButton }

    public class InputHelper
    {
        public KeyboardState currentKeyboardState = new KeyboardState();
        public MouseState currentMouseState = new MouseState();
        public KeyboardState lastKeyboardState = new KeyboardState();
        public MouseState lastMouseState = new MouseState();
        public Vector2 cursorPos = new Vector2(0, 0);

        public InputHelper() {}

        public void Update()
        {
            lastKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState;
            lastMouseState = currentMouseState;

            currentKeyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();
            currentMouseState = Mouse.GetState();

            //track cursor position
            cursorPos.X = currentMouseState.X;
            cursorPos.Y = currentMouseState.Y;
        }

        //check for keyboard key press, hold, and release
        public bool IsNewKeyPress(Keys key)
        {
            return (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(key) && 
                lastKeyboardState.IsKeyUp(key));
        }

        public bool IsKeyDown(Keys key)
        { return (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(key)); }

        public bool IsNewKeyRelease(Keys key)
        {
            return (lastKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(key) && 
                currentKeyboardState.IsKeyUp(key));
        }

        public bool IsNewMouseButtonPress(MouseButtons button)
        {   //check to see the mouse button was pressed
            if (button == MouseButtons.LeftButton)
            {
                return (currentMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed &&
                    lastMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Released);
            }
            else if (button == MouseButtons.RightButton)
            {
                return (currentMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Pressed && 
                    lastMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Released);
            }
            else { return false; }
        }

        public bool IsNewMouseButtonRelease(MouseButtons button)
        {   //check to see the mouse button was released
            if (button == MouseButtons.LeftButton)
            {
                return (lastMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed && 
                    currentMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Released);

<h3>Understanding InputHelper.cs</h3>
<p>
Our new InputHelper class introduces several new keywords and concepts, so let's examine all of them.<br>
First, look at the <b>using</b> statements at the top of the class.<br>
Notice that we are using <b>Microsoft.Xna.Framework</b> and <b>Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input</b>.<br>
Members of our InputHelper class are defined in these Microsoft.Xna classes.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="6" readonly>
using System;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;
</textarea>	





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>MouseButton Enumerator</h3>
<p>
Now let's look at our new enumerator <b>MouseButtons</b>.<br>
An enumerator is used to iterate over a collection of items.<br>
In this case, we have defined two items in our collection <b>MouseButtons</b> - LeftButton and RightButton.<br>
These two items represent the Left and Right Buttons of the user's mouse.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="4" readonly>
public enum MouseButtons { LeftButton, RightButton }
</textarea>	





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Inspecting InputHelper's Members</h3>
<p>
Let's inspect the members of our InputHelper now.<br>
Below we define several new variables with different class types.<br>
The class types KeyboardState and MouseState are defined in Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.<br>
The class type Vector2 is defined in Microsoft.Xna.Framework.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="8" readonly>
public KeyboardState currentKeyboardState = new KeyboardState();
public MouseState currentMouseState = new MouseState();
public KeyboardState lastKeyboardState = new KeyboardState();
public MouseState lastMouseState = new MouseState();
public Vector2 cursorPos = new Vector2(0, 0);
</textarea>	
<p>
<b>KeyboardState</b> is a class that represents a user's keyboard. <br>
If a key is pressed, this is represented in KeyboardState.<br>
We create a current keyboard state, and a last keyboard state.<br>
These two instances allow us to see if a user pressed a key, is holding a key, or released a key.<br>
<br>
<b>MouseState</b> is a class that represents a user's mouse.<br>
If a mouse button is pressed, this is represented in MouseState.<br>
We create a current mouse state, and a last mouse state.<br>
These two instances allows us to see if a user pressed a mouse button, is holding a button, or released a button.<br>
<br>
Finally we have <b>Vector2</b>. Vector2 has two floats, X and Y.<br>
This Vector2, known as CursorPos, represents where on the screen our cursor is.<br>
We initially set our Vector2 variable to 0.<br>
</p>







<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Understanding Update()</h3>
<p>
Examine the Update Method below.<br>
In this method, we capture the previous frame's keyboard and mouse state.<br>
Then we capture the current frame's keyboard and mouse state.<br>
Later we will compare the previous and current states to reason about the user's input.<br>
Finally we capture the mouse's screen position in cursorPos.<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="16" readonly>
public void Update()
{
	lastKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState;
	lastMouseState = currentMouseState;

	currentKeyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();
	currentMouseState = Mouse.GetState();

	//track cursor position
	cursorPos.X = currentMouseState.X;
	cursorPos.Y = currentMouseState.Y;
}
</textarea>	






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Understanding The Keyboard Methods</h3>
<p>
Examine the methods below.<br>
<br>
<b>IsKeyDown()</b> checks to see if the passed Key parameter is being held down in currentKeyboardState.<br>
Note the Key parameter. This allows the function to check whatever Key is passed to it.<br>
<br>
<b>IsNewKeyPress()</b> compares previous keyboard state to current keyboard state . <br>
If the current state is down, and the previous state was up, then the key press occurred on this frame.<br>
Note that IsNewKeyPress() takes a Key parameter just like IsKeyDown().<br>
<br>
<b>IsNewKeyRelease()</b> can be thought of as the opposite of IsNewKeyPress().<br>
If the last state was down, and the current state is up, then the key release occurred on this frame.<br>
Note that IsNewKeyRelease() takes a Key parameter just like IsKeyDown().<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="15" readonly>
//check for keyboard key press, hold, and release

public bool IsKeyDown(Keys key)
{ return (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(key)); }

public bool IsNewKeyPress(Keys key)
{ return (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(key) && lastKeyboardState.IsKeyUp(key)); }

public bool IsNewKeyRelease(Keys key)
{ return (lastKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(key) && currentKeyboardState.IsKeyUp(key)); }
</textarea>	




<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Understanding The Mouse Methods</h3>
<p>
Examine the methods below.<br>
<br>
<b>IsMouseButtonDown()</b> checks to see if the passed MouseButton parameter is being held down in currentMouseState.<br>
Note the MouseButtons parameter. This allows the function to check either Left or Right MouseButtons.<br>
<br>
<b>IsNewMouseButtonPress()</b> compares previous mouse state to current mouse state . <br>
If the current state is down, and the previous state was up, then the button press occurred on this frame.<br>
Note that IsNewMouseButtonPress() takes a MouseButton parameter just like IsMouseButtonDown().<br>
<br>
<b>IsNewMouseButtonRelease()</b> can be thought of as the opposite of IsNewMouseButtonPress().<br>
If the last state was down, and the current state is up, then the button release occurred on this frame.<br>
Note that IsNewMouseButtonRelease() takes a MouseButton parameter just like IsMouseButtonDown().<br>
</p>
<textarea rows="45" readonly>
public Boolean IsMouseButtonDown(MouseButtons button)
{  	//check to see if the mouse button is being held down
	if (button == MouseButtons.LeftButton)
	{ return (currentMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed); }
	else if (button == MouseButtons.RightButton)
	{ return (currentMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Pressed); }
	else { return false; }
}

public bool IsNewMouseButtonPress(MouseButtons button)
{	//check to see the mouse button was pressed
	if (button == MouseButtons.LeftButton)
	{
		return (currentMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed &&
			lastMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Released);
	}
	else if (button == MouseButtons.RightButton)
	{
		return (currentMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Pressed && 
			lastMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Released);
	}
	else { return false; }
}

public bool IsNewMouseButtonRelease(MouseButtons button)
{	//check to see the mouse button was released
	if (button == MouseButtons.LeftButton)
	{
		return (lastMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed && 
			currentMouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Released);
	}
	else if (button == MouseButtons.RightButton)
	{
		return (lastMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Pressed && 
			currentMouseState.RightButton == ButtonState.Released);
	}
	else { return false; }
}
</textarea>	





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
You created InputHelper.cs.<br>
You inspected InputHelper's members and methods.<br>
You should understand how key presses and releases are tracked using previous and current keyboard states.<br>
You should understand how button presses and releases are tracked using previous and current mouse states.<br>
<br>
Next we will <a href="InputHelperAdd.html" target="display">Add InputHelper to Game</a> and interact with it.<br>
