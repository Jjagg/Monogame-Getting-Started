<h1>The Blank Frame Test</h1>
<p>
This test times how long it takes to draw a blank monogame frame.<br>
</p>

<h3>Test Requirements</h3>
<p>
This test draws text to the screen, using a sprite font.<br>
Follow the <a href="FontAddingSpritefont.html" target="display">Adding A Bitmap SpriteFont article </a> 
to add a sprite font asset to an empty monogame project.<br>
Replace the contents of Game1.cs with the source code provided 
<b><a href="../Assets/TimeTestBlankFrame.txt" >here</a></b>.<br>
You may need to change the <i>Content.Load</i> address to the sprite font you are using.<br>
