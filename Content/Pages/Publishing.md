In this article, we will discuss publishing a completed game.

Let's get started.


### What is Publishing?


Publishing is the process of selling or sharing your game with others.

There are many approaches to publishing.


The easiest way to share your game with others is to **package it into an archive**.

You'll need to make sure you include your game's dependencies, if you legally can.

Sometimes you cannot legally redistribute a dependency because of it's license.

It's important to know the licensing of the libraries your game requires.

Once you have created an archive you can then post it to a game marketplace, like 
[itch.io](https://itch.io/).


### Selling Your Game


If you want to sell your game, you'll have to consider many things:


- Forming a Business and Paying Taxes
- Copyrighting your Game, Artwork, Sounds, and Logos
- Preventing or Discouraging Piracy
- Promotion and Advertising
- Installation and Support


All of these topics are outside of the scope for a Getting Started Guide.

They are included here to introduce you to the realities of selling a game.

Sharing a game for free is relatively easy and straight forward.

Selling a game can be a very complicated, expensive, and dangerous process.

You should hire legal consultation prior to selling a game or forming a business.


### Hardware Requirements


Determining the hardware requirements for your game can be challenging.

If you are developing for a console, then you know the hardware the game will run on.

If you're developing for desktops or smart phones, the hardware may be old, new, or simply incompatible.

It's very difficult to ensure that your game will run on unknown hardware or software.

Therefore you should provide a list of recommended hardware & software that your game is known to run on.

It's also a good idea to have a website that lists known bugs or errors, so users can get help if they need to.


### When Things Break


In an ideal world, your game installs and runs without issue, and everyone loves it.

However we live in reality, and **in reality there are always problems and bugs with software**.

When there is a problem with a piece of software, it frustrates people.

When something frustrates a person, they start to dislike it.

These frustrated people are more likely to search for, and talk about, their problems online.

And frustrated people, who spent money on a non-functioning product, can be mean.

Let's hope you never experience this, or worse yet - have to deal with it.


When things break, someone has to fix them. If you're a single developer, that person is you.

For this section, I'm going to assume you are the person who has to fix the problem.

I'm going to provide a series of actions that you should take.


**The first thing you should do is clearly communicate that someone is looking into the problem.**

Do not leave players, or customers, in the dark about what's going on.

This makes them feel ignored, which amplifies their belief that the devs only care about their money.

You should also provide frequent updates about your progress resolving the problem.

This doesn't have to be an article or blog post, just a simple tweet will do.


**The second thing you should do is collect as much information about the problem as you can.**

It's a good idea to have an alpha + beta test prior to release.

The reality is that indie devs can't always afford this, or may be working under tight deadlines.

The alternative is to embed debugging tools into the game that write or send crash reports.

You should assume that any information a player gives you has been tainted in some way.

They may think of themselves as genuises and 'solve' the issue, without really understanding the problem.

Their opinions are of little value - you need to collect as much hard, objective data as you can.


**Third - you should understand and reproduce the problem, based on the information available.**

Don't worry about solving it right now. You should focus on fully understanding the problem.

If you can't reproduce the problem, then you can't check to see if you've actually solved it.

If you don't understand the problem, then your solution isn't going to fix it.


**Fourth - you should implement a solution.**

Apply the patch, then test that the problem has been resolved by attempting to reproduce it. 

If your solution fixes the problem, then you need to push out the patch to your game.

On some platforms and marketplaces, patches or updates can cost alot of money.

Financially speaking, it may not be worth fixing a small bug if it costs alot to patch.

Or you may want to wait and release an update that patches multiple bugs.


**Finally, you should document the problem and solution, and notify affected players.**

It's likely that your solution is hacky or brittle - and that's just the nature of patching complex systems.

In the future, if additional work is done to the game's codebase, your patch will likely break.

At this point, it's good to have documentation to refer to when understanding a new problem.

This documentation will likely reduce how long it takes to understand the new problem.

Affected players will appreciate being notified that their particular problem was fixed.

It makes them feel like they were a part of the process, and that their voice mattered.


### The Worst Case Scenario


If you're lucky, you'll never get here.

But for some indie devs, certain things can happen that they are unable to deal with.

Getting sued by a large corporation, for example, will end most indie studios overnight.

Unless you have the money for legal fees and a lengthy trial, you're done.

This is an example of a "Worst Case Scenario", and you should have a plan for it.


If you're reading this, hopefully you're not in a "Worst Case Scenario".

Instead, you're probably just getting into game development.

So think of this section as an introduction on how to avoid these "Worst Case Scenarios".


The vast majority of WCSs stem from a lack of understanding or research.

For example, prior to releasing a game in China, you should do some research on their culture.

Aspects of your game may not be culturally appropriate and there could be serious consequences.


Alot of WCSs also come from copyright violation or improper use of an asset's license.

You should understand the licenses attached to the assets you are using.

If you have created your own assets then you're probably safe.

It's a good idea to patent, trademark, or copyright unique intellectual property.

You should also check to see if any assets you are using are legally protected by copyright.


Other WCSs can arise from hiring people to work on or promote your game.

You should always secure written agreements between employees or independent contractors.

Always, always, always do this. If your game starts making good money, they will want a piece.

A written agreement prevents them from claiming more than they are owed.

It also entitles them to what they are owed - so it keeps everyone honest.


The most common WCS is bankruptcy or dissolution.

Most businesses fail. Almost all businesses lose money for the first few years of operation.

If you don't have enough money to pay the bills and employees, then get loans or sell.

If you can't get loans due to bad credit, then you'll likely have to dissolve the business.

Don't be unaware of this process - it can ruin you financially.


This section may seem to be beyond the scope for a getting started guide, but it's not.

Most game developers are ignorant of the law, and are frequently taken advantage of.

By introducing you to these concepts early on, I hope to make you aware of the pitfalls you may face.

I would contend that knowing your legal rights and obligations is just as important as development.

**If you want to make money developing games, you need to know the law.**
