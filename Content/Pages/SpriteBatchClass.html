<h1>The SpriteBatch Class</h1>


<p>In this article, we will discuss the SpriteBatch class <b>and how Monogame draws</b>.<br>
<br>
SpriteBatch is (basically) responsible for drawing textures and spriteFonts (strings) to the screen.<br>
We will not be discussing the code for drawing textures and fonts to the screen.<br>
Refer to the <a href="TextureDrawing.html" target="display">Texture Drawing article</a> 
and the <a href="FontDrawing.html" target="display">Font Drawing article</a> for code examples.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>














<br><br>
<h3>What does the SpriteBatch class do exactly?</h3>
<p>
You can view the source code for SpriteBatch <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/SpriteBatch.cs">right here</a>.<br>
<br>
SpriteBatch.cs describes itself as a "Helper class for drawing text strings and sprites in one or more optimized batches".<br>
Essentially, SpriteBatch passes textures and strings to another class called SpriteBatcher.cs.<br>
SpriteBatch checks to make sure Textures and SpriteFonts you pass into it are valid.<br>
SpriteBatch also has a variety of Draw() methods that accept various parameters.<br>
<br>
So, SpriteBatch kinda "wraps" the SpriteBatcher class and acts as an intermediary or interface.<br>
For example, you would never interact with the SpriteBatcher class directly.<br>
You would interact with the SpriteBatch class, which would then call _batcher.CreateBatchItem().<br>
SpriteBatch also handles/enforces the Begin() and End() calls necessary for drawing.<br>
Note that drawing actually occurs in the End() method, which calls _batcher.DrawBatch().<br>
</p>




<br><br>
<h3>Ok, What does the SpriteBatcher class do?</h3>
<p>
You can view the source code for SpriteBatcher <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/SpriteBatcher.cs">right here</a>.<br>
<br>
SpriteBatcher.cs describes itself as a "class that handles the queueing of batch items into the GPU...".<br>
This is done by "creating triangle tesselations that are used to draw the sprite textures".<br>
Technically, SpriteBatcher doesn't interact with the GPU directly - it calls a GraphicsDevice method.<br>
SpriteBatcher's drawing is done through the GraphicsDevice method <i>DrawUserIndexedPrimitives();</i>.<br>
<br>
SpriteBatcher.cs communicates with the target graphic device, passing it lists of triangles and textures.<br>
SpriteBatcher must be efficient and fast, so it uses pointer indexing to bypass array checking overhead.<br>
Basically, theres a bunch of code in SpriteBatcher that aims to make it as fast as possible.<br>
Note that SpriteBatcher.cs uses a List of SpriteBatchItem instances to efficiently represent "sprites".<br>
</p>



<br><br>
<h3>Hmm, What does the SpriteBatchItem class do?</h3>
<p>
You can view the source code for SpriteBatchItem <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/SpriteBatchItem.cs">right here</a>.<br>
<br>
Think of the SpriteBatchItem class as a rectangular billboard in 3D space.<br>
This billboard has a texture, a position XYZ, and a color.<br>
It also has X and Y Texture Coordinates.<br>
The billboard's corners are represented by 4 VertexPositionColorTexture instances.<br>
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Jeez, What's a VertexPositionColorTexture?</h3>
<p>
Well, it's a point in 3D space that has an XYZ value.<br>
This point, or vertex, also has a Color value.<br>
In addition, it has XY Texture Coordinates.<br>
When you use 4 VertexPositionColorTextures, you can describe a billboard in 3D space - like the SpriteBatchItem class.<br>
</p>




<br><br>
<h3>What's a GraphicsDevice?</h3>
<p>
You can view the source code for GraphicsDevice <a href="https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/GraphicsDevice.cs">right here</a>.<br>
<br>
Well, the GraphicsDevice classes are... complicated. <b>Very complicated</b>.<br>
A GraphicsDevice communicates with a graphics API like OpenGL or DirectX.<br>
A GraphicsDevice's code path is also controlled by the target platform.<br>
The GraphicsDevice basically handles communication between the graphics API, the target platform, and your game.<br>
It handles communication, translation, and manages graphical state for many disparate systems.<br>
<br>
The GraphicsDevice presents generic methods for interacting with the supported graphics APIs.<br>
By doing this, the SpriteBatch/SpriteBatcher classes don't need to know or interact with specific graphics APIs.<br>
Because your codebase can only call SpriteBatch's methods, your codebase never needs to interact with a graphics API either.<br>
This allows your codebase to be (more) cross-platform.<br>
<br>
You might recall that the GraphicsDevice is used by SpriteBatcher to draw textured rectangles or triangles to the screen.<br>
This is done using the DrawUserIndexedPrimitives() method.<br>
How this method is actually implemented <b>depends on the graphics API</b>.<br>
For example, if the project uses OpenGL, then DrawUserIndexedPrimitives() either calls <b>GL.DrawElements()</b> or <b>GL.DrawArrays()</b>.<br>
If the project uses DirectX, then DrawUserIndexedPrimitives() either calls <b>_d3dContext.Draw</b> or <b>_d3dContext.DrawIndexed()</b>.<br>
<br>
Explaining OpenGL or DirectX is way beyond the scope of this getting started guide.<br>
Entire books are dedicated to these subjects. If you'd like to learn more, there are many resources available.<br>
