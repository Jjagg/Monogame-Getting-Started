<h1>Game Examples</h1>

<p>
In this article, we will discuss source code, codebases, and example games.<br>
The best way to learn about game development is to study and write source code.<br>
It's advisable that you first study game code prior to attempting to write it.<br>
By learning how others have solved problems, you won't make costly and frustrating mistakes.<br>
Let's get started.<br>
</p>


<p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Finding Source Code</h3>
It can be hard to find source code for popular, or commercial games.<br>
<b>And it can be even harder to understand it.</b><br>
Alot of effort and knowledge is densely packed into each codebase.<br>
I suggest you start with simple codebases and gradually work up to studying more complex ones.<br>






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>My Codebases</h3>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MrGrak">I've created several repos</a>
with a focus on simplicity and minimalizing abstraction.<br>
These are easy to understand, approachable codebases for games and applications.<br>
I think these are a good starting point for new monogame developers.<br>






<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Classic XNA Tutorials</h3>
<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203893.aspx">Microsoft's</a>
official XNA tutorials are a great starting point.
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/xna-tutorials">RBWhitaker</a>
created a great series of XNA tutorials several years ago.
<br>
These still apply to Monogame, although you'll probably run into small errors or syntax bugs.<br>
These are the tutorials I followed when I first started with XNA.<br>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Commercial Codebases Worth Studying</h3>

I suggest looking into the various codebases that 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/id-Software">ID software</a> has released.
<br>
Fabien Sanglard provides his insight into the Doom Engine code 
<a target="_blank" href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php">here</a>.
<br>
Keep in mind that these codebases are built by teams with decades of experience.<br>
It can feel overwhelming trying to understand it all. Focus on understanding a line at a time.<br>



<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Taking It Further</h3>

I highly suggest watching GDC talks on game design.<br>
Here are a few of my favorites.<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Q_zHG3vqg">Multithreading the Entire Destiny Engine</a><br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS-2-Q7RWLk">Building Customizable Characters for Destiny</a><br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4NZ8i80QI">Destiny's Tenacious Design and Interface</a><br>
