<h1>Understanding Design and Scope</h1>
<p>In this article, we will discuss game design and game scope.<br>
Let's get started.</p>
<br>




<br><br>
<h3>What is Game Design?</h3>
<p>
<b>Game Design</b> refers to the process of planning the content, rules, and gameplay of a game.<br>
You make choices about the type of art and sound the game will use.<br>
You will decide how the user controls and interacts with the game.<br>
You plan the rules and conditions of winning, losing, and progressing.<br>
<br>
Game Design is not a simple topic that can be described in a few sentences.<br>
In fact, Game Design can mean different things to different people.<br>
<br>
One person may focus on the characters and their stories, and the game's story.<br>
While another person may focus on the art and sound and experience of the game.<br>
Another person may focus on how the art and sound is programmed and interacted with.<br>
All of these people are designing aspects of a game.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Managing Game Design</h3>
<p>
As an indie developer, with a small team and small budget, it can be hard to manage a game's design.<br>
It is advisable that you start small, finish fast, then build upon those successes.<br>
After a few projects you will start to understand what's possible and how to design better.<br>
Keep in mind that it's all a learning experience - sometimes the most valuable knowledge comes from failure.<br>
<br>
</p>





<br><br><br><br>
<h3>What is Game Scope?</h3>
<p>
The term <b>Scope</b> refers to the features and functionality that your game will have.<br>
It's suggested that you limit the scope of your games as much as possible.<br>
Why would you want to limit your game? Because <b>a game without limits never gets finished.</b><br>
Scope is also the discipline of removing game mechanics that don't support the core gameplay.<br>
<br>
Generally as scope increases, so does the amount of work necessary to complete the game.<br>
And while some ideas sound cool at first, they can be implemented poorly, or just don't fit.<br>
Managing scope is hard to do. Even big companies with big budgets often manage a game's scope poorly.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Managing Game Scope</h3>
<p>
<b>As an indie developer, you must be wary not to get caught in the trap of ever expanding scope.</b><br>
Scrape away features and functionality until only the core gameplay remains.<br>
You may also want to simplify the core gameplay down to the essentials.<br>
Scope is best managed by creating a clear <b>Game Design Document</b>.<br>
</p>



<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Game Design Document</h3>
<p>
A Game Design Document attempts to describe every aspect of a game project, including:<br>
<ul>
  <li>gameplay</li>
  <li>art</li>
  <li>level design</li>
  <li>story</li>
  <li>characters</li>
  <li>user interface</li>
  <li>assets</li>
  <li>target audience</li>
  <li>sound, music</li>
  <li>game controls</li>
</ul> 

<br>
Game Design Documents are used to organize effort during development.<br>
A GDD should be made in the pre-production stage of development, prior to codebase creation.<br>
GDDs often start as conceptual and incomplete, and are changed as development happens.<br>
There is no standard GDD template to follow. The structure and content is up to you.<br>
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
You should now have an understanding of what game design and scope is.<br>
