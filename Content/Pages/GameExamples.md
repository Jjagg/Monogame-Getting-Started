In this article, we will discuss source code, codebases, and example games.

The best way to learn about game development is to study and write source code.

It's advisable that you first study game code prior to attempting to write it.

By learning how others have solved problems, you won't make costly and frustrating mistakes.

Let's get started.


### Finding Source Code

It can be hard to find source code for popular, or commercial games.

**And it can be even harder to understand it.**

Alot of effort and knowledge is densely packed into each codebase.

I suggest you start with simple codebases and gradually work up to studying more complex ones.


### My Codebases

[I've created several repos](https://github.com/MrGrak)
with a focus on simplicity and minimalizing abstraction.

These are easy to understand, approachable codebases for games and applications.

I think these are a good starting point for new monogame developers.


### Classic XNA Tutorials

[Microsoft's](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203893.aspx)
official XNA tutorials are a great starting point.


[RBWhitaker](http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/xna-tutorials)
created a great series of XNA tutorials several years ago.


These still apply to Monogame, although you'll probably run into small errors or syntax bugs.

These are the tutorials I followed when I first started with XNA.


### Commercial Codebases Worth Studying


I suggest looking into the various codebases that 
[ID software](https://github.com/id-Software) has released.


Fabien Sanglard provides his insight into the Doom Engine code 
[here](http://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php).


Keep in mind that these codebases are built by teams with decades of experience.

It can feel overwhelming trying to understand it all. Focus on understanding a line at a time.


### Taking It Further


I highly suggest watching GDC talks on game design.

Here are a few of my favorites.
